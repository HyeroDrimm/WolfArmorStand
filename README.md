# Horse Armor Stand
## What is this mod about
Well, the name says it all, it adds a Horse Armor Stand and just like with the classic armor stand in vanilla, you can display your favorite horse armor.

It should work with no problem with any mods, that add vanilla-looking (without fancy models) armor to the game.

## How to obtain
Well you see it's quite simple, you need to craft it like this:
